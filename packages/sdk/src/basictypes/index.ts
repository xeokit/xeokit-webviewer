 * # xeokit Basic Semantic Data Types
 *
 * This module defines numeric constants representing a basic set of entity and relationship types.
 *
 * ## Key Features
 * - Assigns fundamental types to {@link data!DataObject | DataObjects} and {@link data!Relationship | Relationships},
 *   treating them as elements within an entity-relationship graph.
 * - Integrates with {@link treeview | treeview} to configure the appearance and behavior of
 *   {@link treeview!TreeView | TreeViews} for navigating basic hierarchical structures.
 *
 * ## Installation
 * ```bash
 * npm install @xeokit/sdk
 * ```
 *
 * ## Usage
 * ```javascript
 * import { BasicEntity, BasicAggregation } from "@xeokit/sdk/basictypes";
 * ```
 *
 * @module basictypes
