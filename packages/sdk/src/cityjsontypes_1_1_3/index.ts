 * # xeokit CityJSON 1.1.3 Data Types
 *
 * * Defines numeric constants for the set of [CityJSON](https://xeokit.github.io/sdk/docs/pages/GLOSSARY.html#cityjson) 1.1.3 entity and relationship types.
 * * Use with {@link data | data} to assign CityJSON types to {@link data!DataObject | DataObjects}
 *   and {@link data!Relationship | Relationships} and treat them as elements of a basic entity-relationship graph.
 * * Use with {@link "treeview" | treeview} to configure the appearance and behavior of
 *   {@link treeview!TreeView | TreeViews} for navigating CityJSON objects.
 *
 * # Installation
