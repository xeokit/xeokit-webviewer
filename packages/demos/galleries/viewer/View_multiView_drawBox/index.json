    "summary": "Create a Viewer configured with a WebGLRenderer, a Scene, and three Views. In the Scene, build a SceneModel containing a simple box-shaped triangle mesh. The Viewer then draws the box in each View's canvas. While this is happening, orbit each View's Camera and animate the colors of the object in the main View."
