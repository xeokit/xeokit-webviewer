    "Import xeokit SDK via the JavaScript bundle that we've built for these examples",
    "Create a Scene to hold geometry and materials for our model",
    "Create a WebGLRenderer to use the browser's WebGL API for 3D graphics",
    "Create a Viewer that views our Scene using the WebGLRenderer. Note that the\nScene and WebGLRenderer can only be attached to one Viewer at a time.",
    "Configure the Viewer using the given ViewerParams object. This will\ncreate and configure a single View within the Viewer.",
    "Add a CameraControl to interactively control the View's Camera with keyboard,\nmouse and touch input",

    "TrianglesPrimitive (defined in @xeokit/constants)\n64-bit floats",
    "Build the SceneModel, causing the model to appear in the View's canvas."
