    "Import the SDK from a bundle built for these examples",
    "Create a Scene to hold geometry and materials for our triangle",
    "Create a WebGLRenderer to use the browser's WebGL API to draw the Scene",
    "Create a Viewer that views our Scene using the WebGLRenderer. Note that the\nScene and WebGLRenderer can only be attached to one Viewer at a time.",
    "Add a View, which will render an independent view of the Scene within the\ngiven DOM element.",
    "Position the View's Camera",
    "Default\nDefault\nDefault",
    "Add a CameraControl to interactively control the Camera with keyboard,\nmouse and touch input",
    "Within the Scene, create a SceneModel to hold geometry and materials for our model",
    "Create a SceneGeometry that defines that shape of our triangle",
    "Create a SceneMesh that defines both the shape and\nthe surface appearance of our triangle",
    "Default",
    "Create a SceneObject that defines the triangle object itself",
    "Build the SceneModel, which causes the triangle to appear in the View's canvas.",
    "At this point, the View will contain a single ViewObject that has the same\nID as the SceneObject. Through the ViewObject, we can now update the\nappearance of the box in that View."
