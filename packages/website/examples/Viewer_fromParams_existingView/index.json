Configure the Viewer with the given ViewerParams, which have a ViewParams with the same ID as the View. The View then receives whatever updated properties are provided in the ViewParams.",

    "Import xeokit SDK via the JavaScript bundle that we've built for these examples",
    "Create a Scene to hold geometry and materials for our model",
