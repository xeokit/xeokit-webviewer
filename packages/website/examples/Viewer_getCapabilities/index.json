  "type": "example",
  "steps": [
    "Import xeokit SDK via the JavaScript bundle that we've built for these examples",
    "Create a Scene to hold geometry and materials for our model",
    "Create a WebGLRenderer to use the browser's WebGL API for 3D graphics",
    "Create a Viewer that views our Scene using the WebGLRenderer. Note that the\nScene and WebGLRenderer can only be attached to one Viewer at a time.",
    "Ignore the DemoHelper",
    "Request the Viewerâ€™s Capabilities to determine the features it supports.",
    "Add a View, which will render an independent view of the Scene within the\ngiven DOM element.",
    "Default\nDefault\nDefault",
    "Add a CameraControl to interactively control the Camera with keyboard,\nmouse and touch input",
    "Create a minimal SceneModel that contains a single triangle",
    "Build the SceneModel, which causes the triangle to appear in the View's canvas.",
    "At this point, the View will contain a single ViewObject that has the same\nID as the SceneObject. Through the ViewObject, we can now update the\nappearance of the triangle in that View."
